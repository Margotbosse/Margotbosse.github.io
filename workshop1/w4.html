      "If language ceased to exist and coding became the exclusive language then there would be one less complex element that differentiates the world.  This can make languages less complex and simpler and allows others to understand the language." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>

    <blockquote>
      "Languages and coding share some of the same characteristics.  They are both complex yet simple.  Understanding the code is simple but developing it and writing it is complex.  Whereas speaking a language is simple and understanding the culture of the particular language is complex.  When coding is introduced it simplifies the language because it is univeral and can be understood by many different people."
